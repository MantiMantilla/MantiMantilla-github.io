description: "I may be shy at times, but languages is what i do. I'm a native Spanish speaker, my English is fluent (beyond C1), my german is certified C1, and I'm getting my french back in check (last I looked I was near B1). Also, I've been playing the piano for a few years (yes, music is a language)."
