description: "Though only one of my most recent interests, I've been spending a lot of time learning about Frontend development technologies such as React and Gatsby. Has my effort paid off? See for yourself! Though right now this website is little more than a Gatsby template built on React and Tailwind, I'm constantly working to make it my own by customizing its components. GraphQL is godsent."
